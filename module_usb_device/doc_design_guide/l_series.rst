L-Series support
================

The USB Device Library has been designed primarily for use with xCORE-USB (U-Series)
devices. However, it does also support L-Series devices. This section describe the
resource usage on the L-Series and changes required to build for L-Series devices.

Resource requirements
---------------------

The resources used by the USB device and XUD libraries combined on an L-Series
device are shown below:

+------------------+-----------------+
| Resource         | Requirements    |
+==================+=================+
| Logical Cores    | 2 plus one per  |
|                  | endpoint        |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Channels         | 2 for Endpoint0 |
|                  | and 1 additional|
|                  | per IN and OUT  |
|                  | endpoint        |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Timers           | 3 timers        |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Clock blocks     | Clock block 0   |
|                  |                 |
+------------------+-----------------+

*Note:* On the L-Series the XUD library uses clock block 0 and configures it 
to be clocked by the 60MHz clock from the ULPI transceiver. The ports it
uses are in turn clocked from the clock block. Since clock block 0 is
the default for all ports when enabled it is important that if a port
is not required to be clocked from this 60MHz clock, then it is configured
to use another clock block.

Ports and pins
--------------

The ports used for the physical connection to the external ULPI transceiver must
be connected as shown in :ref:`table_usb_device_ulpi_required_pin_port`.

    | X0D24 | P1I0  |              | ULPI_RST_N          |
    +-------+-------+------+-------+---------------------+

In addition some ports are used internally when the XUD library is in
operation. For example pins X0D2-X0D9, X0D26-X0D33 and X0D37-X0D43 on
an XS1-L8-128 device should not be used. 

Please refer to the device datasheet for further information on which ports
are available.

Reset requirements
------------------

On the L-Series the ``XUD_Manager`` requires a reset port and a reset clock block
to be given.

.. _usb_device_building_for_l_series:

Building for L-Series
---------------------

**Note:** ``module_usb_device`` and ``module_xud`` upon which it depends both support
both U-Series and L-Series devices, but the xSOFTip Explorer will only perform resource
estimation with the U-Series library.

**Note:** Also, tools before the 13.0 release do not support automatically changing a
target library. Therefore, if using xTIMEcomposer pre-13.0 the ``Makefile`` generated will
have to be modified in order to compile for an L-Series device. Open the ``Makefile``
and add the line ``MODULE_LIBRARIES = xud_l``.
